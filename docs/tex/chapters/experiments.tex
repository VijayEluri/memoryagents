%The fact is the more an agent actually sees the more successful he is in staying alive.

%Too much communication might lead to disorientation of an agent which is subsequently followed by agent's death.

\section{Experimental settings and methodology}

All following experiments are run using a default setup as it is described in this section. Each of the experiments is run on a quadcore \emph{Intel Core i5 with 2,4 GHz and 6 GB RAM}. 
                                                   
Environment is set to be a square matrix with \emph{64 x 64 dimension}. All agents start in the middle of the environment. There are \emph{six kinds of food} which are randomly positioned in the environment and which generate a piece of food each \emph{50 steps}.

Since an environment contains of six food kinds, an agent has six internal variables for each such food kind (see \ref{experiments:singleagent}). By default they are set to 0 and are increased by \emph{0.001 each step} in simulation. When they are equal to 1 (or higher), the agent dies.

\section{Homogeneus agent set comparision with communication}

In this experiment I will compare avarage life span and efficiency of groups which contains of agents with only single type of memory. Thereby you can see which of the used memory implementation works better in memory homogeneus environment.

What I assume is the \emph{random agents} are about to expire almost immediately as they had no chance to find all the food. While the \emph{PR agents} should approach their goals easily, thereby they will stay alive. Both results of \emph{GNG agent} and \emph{grid agent} are matters of the experiment and I can only expect them not to be worse than \emph{random agent} and not to be better than \emph{PR agent}.

\subsection{Random agent}   

As for the random agents I assumed that they will immediately pass away without communication. And as you can see in \ref{experiments:random-silent} it happened to be true. 

On the other hand, if I allow them to communicate with each other it might happen they improve their chances. Although they will not last through the entire simulation (see \ref{experiments:gng-grid-pr-random}), the result is that they have managed to slow down [it] (see \ref{experiments:random-start}).

\subsection{PR agent}

In case of the \emph{pure reactive agents} there is not much to compare between simulation with and without the communication, because the communication is not used since the PR agents see all the environment. So both graphs \ref{experiments:pr} and \ref{experiments:pr-silent} are the same.

\begin{center}   
  \begin{tabular}{l*{6}{c}r}
  Agent kind        & median & mean & min & max \\
  \hline  
  PR agents with communication        & 0.69 & 0.689 & 0.54 & 0.86 \\
  PR agents without communication     & 0.69 & 0.689 & 0.54 & 0.86 \\

\subsection{GNG agent}

GNG agents need more information to be able to learn and to survive that is why I do not expect them to deal with it well. In case of a simulation without communication they might end up similarly to random agents, they should do better if they communicate.

\begin{center}

  GNG agents without communication        & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\

\end{figure} 

\clearpage

\subsection{Grid agent}            

I assumed they will do simirarly like GNG agent, i.e. they fail to survive without communication, which assumption ended up to be wrong. Grid agents are able to learn quickly the environment just by moving around randomly and there is the chance that a couple of them survive.

I have run 20 simulations with grid agents to verify the probability of grid agent's learning the environment. As in the standard experiments there were 12 agents and the following values shows the result of the tests:

\section{Mixed environment}
                        
Second part of the experiments are about environment where different kinds of agents are trying to fulfill their needs. I will observer whether some kind of agents prosper from a presence of other agents or if they are not that successful as they were in a homogeneous environment in previous experiments.
                                                                                
\subsection{GNG+Grid+PR+Random agents}

First I will start with combination of all kinds of agents, whereby since there are those PR agents the others have an advantage of the perfect source of information.

\subsection{GNG+Grid+Random agents}

In this experiment I have omitted pure reactive agents and thus left others on their own. For better comparision I have added the difference between values in the current experiment and the previous one (GNG+Grid+PR+Random). I used red colour for a decrease and green colour for an increase, although it is an improvement if they values are lower.
