\section{Agents}

There are several ways where to start explaining what or who the agent is. Apart from systems of agents used in philosophy or sociology, we can see a first modern use of agency and agents in economy where they have substited the human with a simpler agent. They intended to simplify their economic models to be able to actually simulate something. Buyers and sellers are typical examples of agents used in simplified market model in microeconomics (see []). In this context agents are entities in the model which can act based on situation in the model.

For area of artificial intelligence we can use the definition of an agent which can be found in []. {...} 

A rational agent refers back to economics where we can find a definition of rational behaviour. Even though it is rather a hypothetical model, as people are usually irrational in their decisions from the economics perspective, their is yet nice definition whereby a rational agent acts as if balancing costs against benefits to arrive at action that maximizes personal advantage (Milton Friedman (1953), Essays in Positive Economics).
