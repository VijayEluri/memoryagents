\chapter{Simulation and used memory architectures}

In this chapter I will describe the simulation, environment and agent's reasoning and communication how it is used in later experiments. 

\section{Simulation}

The {\bf simulation} is consists of a set of agents, a set of generators and a set of pieces of food. According to given settings it sequently processes a number of steps, each of which invokes an agents' life run and eventually generating new food.

It can also contains a couple of monitors which observe the environment or agents.

\section{Environment}

The environemt si a two-dimensional space which contains agents and food. Agents can move around and eat the food which is randomly distributed using the food generators. 

\section{Agent}

As I mentioned previously an agent is an entity in the environment which moves and interact with the world around. The interaction is done through eating food which is a part of the environment and through communication with other agents. The latter one actually changes agents' believes about the environment.

Agent has his needs which influences his desicions as fulfilling his needs keeps him alive. When his internal variables of needs is higher than
