@article{Bratman:practicalreasoning,
    abstract = {{An architecture for a rational agent must allow for means-end reasoning, for the weighing of competing alternatives, and for interactions betwen these two forms of reasoning. Such an architecture must also address the problem of resource boundedness. We sketch a solution of the first problem that points the way to a solution of the second. In particular, we present a high-level specification of the practical-reasoning component of an architecture for a resource-bounded rational agent. In this architecture, a major role of the agent's plans is to constrain the amount of further practical reasoning she must perform. L'architecture d'un agent rationnel doit permettre le raisonnement proc\'{e}dant des fins aux moyens, le choix entre diff\'{e}rentes actions possibles, et l'interaction entre ces deux modes de raisonnement. Elle doit aussi tenir compte des cons\'{e}quences des limites de ressources disponibles. Nous esquissons ici une solution au premier probl\`{e}me qui indique comment on pourrait r\'{e}soudre le second. Nous proposons, en particulier, une sp\'{e}cification abstraite d'un module de g\'{e}n\'{e}ration de plans pour un agent rationnel dont les ressources sont born\'{e}es. Dans cette architecture, le r\&\#x006f;\&\#x030c;le principal des plans d'un agent est de limiter les ressources devant \v{e}tre consacr\'{e}s au raisonnement.}},
